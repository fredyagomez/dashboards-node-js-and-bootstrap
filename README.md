This example demonstrates how to create a simple dashboard using node js in the server side and
bootstrap and other JS visualization libraries. See live example here [Live Dashboard] (http://54.201.121.249:1720) 
This comes with a component to authenticate users using a username and
password with [form-based authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP%2BHTML_form-based_authentication).
